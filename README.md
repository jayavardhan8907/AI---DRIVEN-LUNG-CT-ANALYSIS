# AI---DRIVEN-LUNG-CT-ANALYSIS

AI-Driven Lung CT Analysis
Overview
This project leverages the power of artificial intelligence to analyze lung CT scans for the detection of potential cancerous regions. The underlying model is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, utilizing the pre-trained ViT model from Google with a patch size of 224.

Features
State-of-the-Art Model: The project employs a Vision Transformer model that has been fine-tuned on a custom dataset for accurate lung CT analysis.

Cancer Detection: The AI model predicts whether a given lung CT scan contains cancerous regions or not, providing crucial insights for medical professionals.

Detailed Reports: The system generates comprehensive reports detailing the analysis results, aiding medical practitioners in their decision-making process.

Report Generation by Google Palm: The generated reports are crafted using the Google Palm, which processes the predictions provided by the Vision Transformer model, ensuring reliable and informative output.

How It Works
Training: The Vision Transformer model is trained on a diverse dataset of lung CT scans, incorporating both cancerous and non-cancerous cases.

Prediction: The trained model is then used to predict whether new lung CT scans are indicative of potential cancerous conditions.

Report Generation: The system generates detailed reports using the Google Palm, including visualizations and analysis summaries, to facilitate interpretation by healthcare professionals.

Usage
Input: Provide a lung CT scan image to the system for analysis.

Output: Receive a detailed report indicating the likelihood of cancerous regions within the lung, aiding in early detection and diagnosis.
